# Dotfiles Repo

I created this repo to share my dotfiles.
Currently there isn't all that much to it, apart from the prompt and a few handy alias commands.

I use Alacritty as my go-to terminal.
I use JetBrains Mono (Nerd Fonts patch), which includes the Apple logo, folder and terminal symbols on the prompt.
